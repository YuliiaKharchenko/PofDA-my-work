# The Project on the module "Principles of Data Analytics"
## Analytical work based on the Palmer penguins dataset  


## About This Project

This project aims to analyze the Palmer Penguins dataset using Python. 

The Jupyter notebook ('**penguins.ipynb**') provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, including:

* Overview of variables and their types.
* Suggestions for modeling variables in Python.
* Visualizations including bar charts and histograms.
* Correlation analysis between selected variables.

## Use of This Project

This project is useful for anyone interested in exploring the characteristics of penguins. It provides insights into the relationships between various attributes such as species, bill dimensions, flipper length, body mass, and sex of the penguins.


## Get Started

To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

* pandas.
* numpy.
* matplotlib.
* seaborn.

You can install these libraries using pip:

& pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
